"""
Network Scanner

Description:
    A minimal ARP scanner that discovers devices on the local network and prints
    their IP and MAC addresses. Built with Scapy for quick, readable output.

Usage:
    # Basic scan:
    sudo python3 net_scanner.py -i 192.168.1.0/24

    # Example output:
    Scanning 192.168.1.0/24 ... (run as root if you need)

    --- Device 1 ---
    IP Address:  192.168.1.1
    MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:55

Notes:
    - This script must be run with root privileges (sudo) because it sends raw packets.
    - Requires Python 3 and the `scapy` package.
    - Use responsibly â€” only scan networks you own or have permission to test.

Requirements:
    - Python 3
    - scapy (`pip3 install scapy`)
    - root/sudo
